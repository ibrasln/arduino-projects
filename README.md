# Arduino Basics Projects

This repository contains beginner-friendly Arduino projects that I also share on my TikTok channel.  
Each project has:
- âœ… Arduino code (`.ino`)
- âœ… Circuit design (TinkerCad screenshot)

### 1. Blink
- The "Hello World" of Arduino.
- An LED connected to Pin 13 blinks on and off.
- Components: Arduino Uno, 1x LED, 1x 330Î© resistor, 2x jumper wires.

### 2. LED Lighting With Button
- First interactive project with Arduino.
- Pressing a button lights up an LED, releasing it turns it off.
- Components: Arduino Uno, 1x LED, 1x button, 1x 330Î© resistor (for LED), 5x jumper wires.
- Circuit: LED on Pin 8, Button on Pin 10 (with `INPUT_PULLUP`).
- Why `INPUT_PULLUP`?  
  By default, a pin without a signal can "float" between HIGH and LOW, causing random results.  
  `INPUT_PULLUP` uses Arduinoâ€™s internal resistor to keep the pin stable (default HIGH).  
  When the button is pressed, it connects the pin to GND â†’ the reading becomes LOW.
