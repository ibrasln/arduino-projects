# Arduino Basics Projects

This repository contains beginner-friendly Arduino projects that I also share on my TikTok channel.  
Each project has:
- ✅ Arduino code (`.ino`)
- ✅ Circuit design (TinkerCad screenshot)

## 📚 Projects

### 1. Blink
- The "Hello World" of Arduino.
- An LED connected to Pin 13 blinks on and off.
- Components: Arduino Uno, 1x LED, 1x 330Ω resistor, 2x jumper wires.

### 2. LED Lighting With Button
- First interactive project with Arduino.
- Pressing a button lights up an LED, releasing it turns it off.
- Components: Arduino Uno, 1x LED, 1x button, 1x 330Ω resistor (for LED), 5x jumper wires.
- Circuit: LED on Pin 8, Button on Pin 10 (with `INPUT_PULLUP`).
- Why `INPUT_PULLUP`?  
  By default, a pin without a signal can "float" between HIGH and LOW, causing random results.  
  `INPUT_PULLUP` uses Arduino’s internal resistor to keep the pin stable (default HIGH).  
  When the button is pressed, it connects the pin to GND → the reading becomes LOW.

### 3. Traffic Light
- Simulates a basic traffic light system with 3 LEDs.
- LEDs light up in sequence: red → yellow → green → repeat.
- Components: Arduino Uno, 1x Red LED, 1x Yellow LED, 1x Green LED, 3x 330Ω resistors, 7x jumper wires, 1x breadboard.
- Circuit: Red LED on Pin 11, Yellow LED on Pin 10, Green LED on Pin 9 (all with resistors), cathodes connected to GND.
- Purpose: Demonstrates controlling multiple outputs and using delays for timing.

### 4. Potentiometer LED Brightness
- Control LED brightness using a potentiometer.
- Potentiometer works as a variable resistor: turning the knob changes the voltage on its middle pin.
- Arduino reads this value as analog input (0–1023) and maps it to LED brightness (0–255).
- Components: Arduino Uno, 1x LED, 1x 330Ω resistor, 1x potentiometer (10kΩ), 5x jumper wires, 1x breadboard.
- Circuit: Potentiometer middle pin → A0, side pins → 5V & GND. LED anode → Pin 9 with resistor, cathode → GND.
- Purpose: Introduces analog input with analogRead() and PWM output with analogWrite().

### 5. Knight Rider LEDs
- LEDs light up one by one from left to right, then back again (like the Knight Rider car).
- Uses arrays, `for` loops, and `sizeof` to calculate the number of LEDs automatically.
- Components: Arduino Uno, 5x LEDs, 5x 330Ω resistors, 11x jumper wires, 1x breadboard.
- Circuit: LEDs connected to pins 3–7 (with resistors). Cathodes to GND.
- Purpose: Demonstrates how to manage multiple outputs efficiently with arrays.
- **Key concept: `sizeof`**  
Instead of hardcoding the array length, we calculate it dynamically:
